# LazerBlade3
Chop Long samples to smaller chunks to be chopped and looped in wave-edit
⚡ LAZER BLADE 3 - Pre-Production Sample Preparerv1.0.0 // Terminal Interface for Waveform SurgeryLAZER BLADE 3 is the "Heavy Lifting" module of the MEGAMICRODAW ecosystem. While the Wave-Edit tool is for surgical micro-chops, LAZER BLADE 3 is designed for the initial phase: loading long-form audio (full songs, field recordings, or long synth takes) and extracting perfect, BPM-synced loops.🛠 The Workflow: Why use this first?In the MEGAMICRODAW workflow, you should process your raw assets here before moving them into the sequencer.Ingestion: Load massive files that are too large for the real-time sequencer to handle comfortably.BPM Analysis: The engine automatically calculates potential BPMs ($1$-Bar, $2$-Bar, and $4$-Bar options) based on your selection.The "Lazer" Trim: Drag the Cyan (Start) and Magenta (End) markers to isolate a loop.Export: Save a perfectly trimmed .wav that is ready to be dropped into the Precision Loop Chopper for final zero-crossing alignment.📟 Interface Breakdown[ LOAD SAMPLE ]: Initiates the NEXUS protocol to decode MP3/WAV/OGG into an AudioBuffer.[ PLAY / LOOP ]: Audition your selection. Note: This uses a Hard Loop logic—it will strictly cycle between your markers.[ TRIM BPM ]: Locks in your selection and confirms the mathematical BPM. Use this to verify your loop is a "perfect" bar.[ EXPORT WAV ]: Generates a new 16-bit PCM WAV file containing only the data between your markers.🔬 Technical SpecificationsCRT Glow Engine: Uses text-shadow and terminal-green hex codes for a high-contrast, low-eye-strain environment.Touch-Ready: Built with touch-action: none and DPI-aware canvas scaling, making it functional on mobile "Blade" devices.WAV Encoder: A low-level DataView implementation that writes the RIFF/WAVE header manually, ensuring compatibility with all vintage and modern DAWs.📝 Developer Notes (Memory Markdown)Pre-Edit Logic: Always ensure the "LOOP_WINDOW" duration matches the intended bar length of your project. If your project is 120 BPM, look for the 120.0 BPM indicator in the OPT_1BAR or OPT_2BAR display before exporting.Future Improvements for the Mind Map:Normalization on Export: Automatically scale the AudioBuffer to $0dB$ to ensure consistent volume in the main DAW.Snap-to-Grid: If the BPM is known, allow the markers to "snap" to 1/16th note increments.Direct-to-Chopper: A "Send to Wave-Edit" button to pass the buffer without a file download.
